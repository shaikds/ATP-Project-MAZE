# PART A - ATP-MAZE 
#### Key Functionallities:
* Creation of mazes - Empty, Simply, Custom, 3D. ( Using Prim's algorithm & DFS algorithm for 3D )
* Maze solvers (DFS,BFS,Best Breadth Search)
* design patterns ( Adapter, Strategy )
* Use SOLID Principles
* OOP Design
* Tests to check the maze generators & solvers


# PART B - ATP-MAZE (Other Branch)
#### Key Functionallities:
* Creation of servers - 1. Server for creating mazes 2. Server for solving mazes
* Using thread-pool to handle the requests
* Using decorator & strategy & singleton design patterns
* Config file for deciding type of maze/solution creators


This project has built for BGU university, during Advanced Programming Topic course.
